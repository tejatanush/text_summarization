# Text Summarization
Developed a model for Text summarization using transformers pipeline. This model takes input of an article and summarizes the article in to less length which is readable with understandable words.
### Features  
Import  libraries                                                                                     
Build summarization model                                                                             
Take input and display summarized text.                                                               
### Applications  
* News outlets and platforms use text summarization to provide quick, digestible summaries of lengthy news articles. This allows readers to get the gist of the news without spending much time on the full article.
* Legal professionals use text summarization models to extract key information from lengthy legal documents, such as contracts, case law, or court rulings.
* Companies use text summarization models to analyze and summarize customer feedback, support tickets, and reviews. This helps in quickly identifying common issues or trends in customer sentiment.
